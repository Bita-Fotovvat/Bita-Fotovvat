Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bita Fotovvat, a Full-Stack Developer who loves breathing life into creative ideas!
I use: JavaScript, Html, CSS, Sass, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Knex.
I recently built a travel planner app (React, Node.js) that personalizes adventures and also designed, developed and deployed another website (www.renontario.ca).
When I'm not coding, I'm either creating culinary masterpieces, getting lost in a world of colors on canvas, or exploring the beauty of nature. 
See what other projects I'm working on here, and feel free to connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/bita-fotovvat.
